# The Curriculum Vitae of Ian Rahman

Welcome! I've put together a Swift playground to share a little of who I am.

If you're familiar with iOS development, you shouldn't have any trouble downloading and running the playground file. If you don't feel comfortable with that, feel free to take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/ianrahman/ian-rahman-resume/blob/master/IanRahman_Resume.playground/Contents.swift). It's just a fun way of sharing what you can otherwise find in my [PDF resume](https://github.com/ianrahman/ian-rahman-resume/blob/master/Ian_Rahman_Resume.pdf).

Hope you enjoy!

> PS- Remember to open the debugger console when you run the playground ðŸš€

> PPS- Protocols aren't a [silver bullet](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/protocol-oriented-programming/), but I'm trying to make Crusty proud.
